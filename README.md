# Python Webhook Tool
Sending messages and deleting webhooks.

---

## :clipboard: Overview
The tool itself allows you to send messages through discord webhook, either infinitely (until console is closed) or via specifying amount of messages to send, it also allows to delete webhook.
It was made in about hour as a solution to my boredom, so its far from perfection, but works and that's everything that matters. Have'nt really tried executable because
i didn't want to waste time by seting up a vm, so you might have to run it as a script.
